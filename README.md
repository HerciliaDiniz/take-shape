# TakeShape

TakeShape is a digital marketplace for designers and the artistic community (from beginners to the more experienced folks) to share some of their ideas with the general public. 

It offers visitants the possibility to get to know them by their public profile, see their personal galleries and support their work by buying a version of their creation to apply to one of the items available on the website (currently mugs, but more to come).

It is built with Rails (server-side) and React (client-side)

## Details:

* Ruby 5.2
* ReactJS

## Initial Setup:

* On the project directory, run **bundle**
* Create Database: **rails db:create**
* Seed data: **rails db:seed**
* To restart from zero, run: **rails db:setup**

## How It Works:

* First, create an account. After login, you can: 

* As a visitant:
  1. See all artists profiles
  2. See art's gallery
  3. Apply arts to items and see how the final product would look like
  4. Save your favorite creations 
  5. Favorite an artist and a specific piece of art 


* As an artist:  
  1. Create your artist profile
  2. Upload your creations (add as many images of it as you want). Images need to be saved in PNG with transparent background. Remember to choose a high quality image.
  3. Define how much you want to charge for each piece.
